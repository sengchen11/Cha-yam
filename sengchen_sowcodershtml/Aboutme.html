    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p> Hi, My name is Sengchen Dema from Bhutan.I came up with this project because I believe that awareness on mental health is badly needed in our society and be a model project for others to embrace their mental health. I believe that mental health is so self-evident and inseparable from who we are as humans. It baffles me at times that our society is taking so long to accept it because if we look closely mental health is in everything we do, so understanding it is crucial. </p>
    <p> Mental health is incredibly a taboo in our society. For many people mental illness means you are weak. You should be able to handle your issues and if you can't, you are useless. </p>
      <p> We all perpetuate stigma and it's not our fault. We all hold stigma because we are raised in a society where people are told mental illness is shameful and are encouraged to keep the experiences quite.
        <p> We are all part of the problem but also part of the solution. We need to connect with our shared humanity. Struggle is part of the human experiences and we are all struggling with something. And mental health come with that territory. We need to look for our fellow  humans with compassion and non-judgmental understanding that we have gone through, or are going through something. This project is just a reminder that we can see the human behind the struggle, if we only look. </p>
